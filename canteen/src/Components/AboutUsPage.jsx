                    <p>
                        Founded in 2020, Brainware Canteen started with a simple idea: to provide our community with wholesome, delicious, and quick meals that feel like home. We believe that good food brings people together, and we've made it our mission to be a place where students, faculty, and friends can gather, recharge, and enjoy a great meal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From our signature sandwiches to our freshly brewed coffee, every item on our menu is crafted with care, using locally-sourced ingredients whenever possible.
